# Bookstore Website README
Year 1 Coursework

This repository contains code files for a website designed for a bookstore. The website is intended to showcase books available in the store, provide information about the bookstore, and allow users to navigate through different sections.

## Files Included

1. **index.html**: This file represents the main webpage layout of the bookstore website. It contains the structure of the webpage, including header, navigation buttons, content sections, footer, and styling references.

2. **styles.css**: This file contains the CSS styles used to customize the appearance of the webpage elements defined in the HTML file. It includes styles for the layout, colors, fonts, buttons, navigation bar, image containers, and more.

3. **Catalog.xslt**: This file represents an XSLT stylesheet used to transform XML data into HTML for displaying the bookstore's catalog. It is linked to the XML catalog file to render the catalog information in a structured format on the webpage.

4. **BookstoreCatalog.xml**: This XML file contains a catalog of books available in the bookstore. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, release date, genre, language, and image information.

## Usage

To use the provided code files:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the main webpage layout of the bookstore website.

3. Ensure that the `styles.css` file is in the same directory as the `index.html` file to apply the necessary styles to the webpage elements.

4. Optionally, you can modify the content of the XML catalog file (`BookstoreCatalog.xml`) to add, remove, or update book entries in the catalog. You may also adjust the XSLT stylesheet (`Catalog.xslt`) if necessary for customizing the display of catalog information on the webpage.

## Features
