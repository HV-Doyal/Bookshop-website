# Bookshop-website Year 1
The overall aim of this coursework is to design and develop a 2-page web site for bookshop.  The objectives are:
•	Create a HTML page
•	Demonstrate knowledge of CSS via implementation
•	Create an XML page
•	Demonstrate knowledge of DTD via implementation
•	Design a website that renders data from an XML file (transformation)


Generate the website using a text editor (e.g., NotePad++).

•	The website must contain 2 pages, a main page, and a program page
•	The main page should be a HTML file. It contains general information about the bookshop, such as the address, the contact detail, and the opening times of the bookshop.
•	The main page should contain at least one paragraph, one list and one table. For example, you can include a brief introduction of the bookshop in a paragraph, include the main genres in a list, and the opening time in a table.
•	Feel free to apply different formatting and styling to improve the presentation of the web page (TIP: consider using CSS).
•	The program page should be an XML file. It stores information about the books sold following an XML data schema (TIP: consider using DTD).
•	Ideally when the page is clicked open, the book list will be displayed in a table format (TIP: consider using XSL).
•	Both the main page and the program page contain a link to each other (TIP: consider using the <a> tag).
